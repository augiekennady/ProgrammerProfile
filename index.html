      <h2> Hi! I'm Augie, and I Code Things! </h2> 
      <p> I'm a software developer living in Portland, Oregon.</p> 
      <p> Given my background in e-commerce and education technology, I'm interested in:</p> 
      <ul> 
        <li> e-commerce stores </li> 
        <li> online education </li> 
        <li> educational gaming </li> 
        <li> music education </li> 
        <li> online music creation </li> 
      </ul> 
      <p> Please <a href="mailto:akennady@chegg.com"> let me know </a> if you'd like to collaborate on a project! </p>

      <!-- Now it's time to talk about myself; should be pretty easy, since it's allegedly my favorite subject. :P  --> 


      <h2> About Me </h2>

      <p> I worked in the film industry for six years prior to attending Columbia University. Once in school, I focused on mathematics and film studies while dabbling in a myriad of other subjects.</p> 
      <p> Upon graduation, I found it exceedingly difficult to get work, so I began tutoring! I tutored in many fields of mathematics, as well as economics, astronomy, physics, German, Japanese, film production, film editing, writing, and college application essays. </p> 
      <p> This led to a job in customer support at Chegg, and I worked my way up from customer support to be the manager of business operations, which is what I do now! </p> 
      <p> To support my lavish spending habits and thirst for new knowledge, I also have maintained side employment positions related to marketing e-commerce companies. </p> 
      <p> I'm now working as a consultant in software development so I can learn more about e-commerce trends and hopefully help shape the future of both e-commerce and online education! </p>
