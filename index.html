          <h2> About Me </h2>

          <p> I worked in the film industry for six years prior to attending Columbia University. Once in school, I focused on mathematics and film studies while dabbling in a myriad of other subjects.</p> 

          <p> Upon graduation, I found it exceedingly difficult to get work, so I began tutoring! I tutored in many fields of mathematics, as well as economics, astronomy, physics, German, Japanese, film production, film editing, writing, and college application essays. </p> 

          <p> This led to a job in customer support at Chegg, and I worked my way up from customer support to be the manager of business operations, which is what I do now! </p> 

          <p> To support my lavish spending habits and thirst for new knowledge, I also have maintained side employment positions related to marketing e-commerce companies. </p> 

          <p> I'm now working as a consultant in software development so I can learn more about e-commerce trends and hopefully help shape the future of both e-commerce and online education! </p> 

          <p> Enjoy a picture of my dream car. :) </p>
